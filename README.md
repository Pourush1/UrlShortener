# UrlShortener

> API service to create short Url

# How To Start

```bash
#Install dependencies first using:
npm install

# Now edit the default.json file where you have to use your own mongoURI, right now it is empty because I have to insert the password there and I don't want to make it visible publicly. 
# To get mogoURI, setup a mongo Atlas database account and create a project there, and then create a cluster
```

# Endpoint that creates a short url

## POST service  api/url/shorten
